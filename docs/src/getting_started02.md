# TrjArray type

MDToolbox.jl uses a unique type, called `TrjArray`, for storing and processing MD data. 
When you load MD data with `mdload()`, `mdload()` always generates a variable of `TrjArray` type.
Alternatively, a TrjArray variable can be manyally generated by calling its constructor:

```julia
# TrjArray generated by loading MD data
t = mdload("run.dcd")

# TrjArray variable with single atom and nine-frame coordinates
t = TrjArray(xyz=rand(10, 3))
```

Trajectory variable is a matrix whose row vectors consist of
coordinate variables. The rows represent frames in the trajectory. 
For simulation data, the sequence of frames represents molecular dynamics. 

Thus, for example, the coordinate at the 10th frame is extracted by
::
  
  crd = trj(10, :);

Translation in the x-axis throughout all frames is coded as
::
  
  trj(:, 1:3:end) = trj(:, 1:3:end) + 3.0;

Average coordinate over all frames (without fitting) is obtained by
::
  
  crd = mean(trj);
